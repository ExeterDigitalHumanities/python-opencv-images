# python-opencv-images
A test project for the OpenCV library image processing tools in Python

This project contains some sample images from the Culver House and Hardy Correspondents collections. The aim is to experiment with OpenCV libraries to process these outside of PhotoShop, introducing some automated features and some intelligent analysis such as object detection.

The following examples are available:

### basics01.ipynb
* Reading an image file
* Using CV2 to convert it to greyscale
* Attempting to find bounding boxes for the page image ***not working***

### basics02.ipynb
* Reading a list of files from a data directory
* Processing a file using the thresholding techniques to filter noise (e.g. written print-through)
* Detecting page boundaries in the file and cropping out margins

### basics03.ipynb
* IN PROGRESS!
